As he maneuvers around the complex maze that is the space station, it leaves us to wonder what he’s after. This was my senior thesis at the Rhode Island School of Design. I used Maya for modelling and rigging characters and a mix of motion-capture data and manual keyframing for animating them. Fluid simulations were done in Houdini. Backgrounds were done procedurally through a C++ script, that generated points along a maze which I could sample custom assets along to fill out the space. Check out the GitHub for that project and the video on how I used this method for procedural backgrounds!",

Reward is given to the agent for staying up right and moving in a straight line, but also for following the motion-capture data given to it.
