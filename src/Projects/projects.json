As he maneuvers around the complex maze that is the space station, it leaves us to wonder what he’s after. This was my senior thesis at the Rhode Island School of Design. I used Maya for modelling and rigging characters and a mix of motion-capture data and manual keyframing for animating them. Fluid simulations were done in Houdini. Backgrounds were done procedurally a C++ script, that generated points along a maze which I could generate customa assets along to fill out the space.

The project involved training a humanoid character to perform bipedal movements such as walking and running using Reinforcement Learning in a 3D simulated environment. What makes this project unique compared to other RL methods is the fact that motion-capture data is to accelerate the training process. Reward is given to the agent for staying up right and moving in a straight line, but also for following the motion-capture data given to it. This gave us much higher quality resutls compared to the pure RL methods.",
